	SPEED: 

Number of cycles for the complete dataset:
	
11030 cycles

Number of clocks pr. data point:
	
44 cycles

Average number of clocks pr. data point:

44.12 ~ 44 cycles  (Meaning, all cycles are approximately of equal length)



Critical data path: 

REG -> ALU -> MUX -> REG
From Lecture example: 
	Read/write: 		 25 ns.
	Arithmetic computations: 50 ns.


Most critical path time: 
	Read + Arithmetic computation + Write
	25 ns + 50 ns + 25 ns = 100 ns.

Meaning the relative clock time should be set at 100 ns.
With 44 cycles pr data point, the total time pr data point is: 4.4 us. 
After 10 000 data points, we get a reference time: 44 000 us = 44 ms.
Running at a clock frequency at 10 MHz.

This is slower than the test in assignment 1, but this was tested on a modern laptop CPU. 
The processor of the laptop from assignment 1, runs at a frequency of 2.7 GHz, meaning it has a 270 times shorter clock cycle.
